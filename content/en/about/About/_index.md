    About ObserveRTC
---

Making analytical tools for Real Time Communication (RTC) is fun! However it is challenging. You need to consider strict time limitations of real-time streams, and tightly integrate services that can report to your monitoring solutions with micro second accuracy. 

Here is how ObserveRTC comes into the picture. We make RTC development fun and easy using open-source tools. ObserveRTC aims to provide client side integrations, infrastructure and monitoring tools to observe and analyse WebRTC applications.

### What is WebRTC?

"With WebRTC, you can add real-time communication capabilities to your application that works on top of an open standard. It supports video, voice, and generic data to be sent between peers, allowing developers to build powerful voice- and video-communication solutions. The technology is available on all modern browsers as well as on native clients for all major platforms" - quote from https://webrtc.org/

### ObserveRTC for WebRTC

For WebRTC we are working on the following services:

 * [WebExtrApp](https://github.com/ObserveRTC/webextrapp) A client library that collects WebRTC platform provided stats.

 * [WebRTC-Observer](https://github.com/ObserveRTC/webrtc-observer) An infrastrcutre for observing your WebRTC deployments. 
 
 * [WebExtrApp-Integrations](https://github.com/ObserveRTC/integrations) Various platform integrations for different video platforms providing [WebRTCStats](https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc-stats/).
