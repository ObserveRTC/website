Making analytical tools for Real Time Communication is fun!
However it is challenging. We need to consider strict time 
limitations to avoid influencing the stream, and
we need to integrate as many services as we can with one service. 
Here, in ObserveRTC, we develop open-source tools for everyone 
in order to make development for RTC fun and easy.
