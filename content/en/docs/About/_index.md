Making analytical tools for Real Time Communication is fun!
However it is challenging. You need to consider strict time 
limitations to avoid influencing the stream, and
you need to integrate as many services as you can to report to 
one monitor. 
Here is, how ObserveRTC comes into the picture.
In ObserveRTC, we develop open-source tools for everyone 
in order to make development for RTC fun and easy. 

# Actual Projects

## WebRTC

Web Real-time communication (WebRTC) 
has been emerged over the last couple of years, and the 
wide-scale deployment of real-time multimedia communications 
on the Internet encouraged the industry to massively use 
WebRTC application as part of their infrastructure. 
However, monitoring these solutions becomes critical. 

ObserveRTC is aim to provide integrations and monitoring tools 
to observe and analyse WebRTC applications.

For WebRTC we are working on the following services:

 * [WebRTC-Observer](https://github.com/ObserveRTC/webrtc-observer) Observer for WebRTC peer connections
 * [WebExtrApp](https://github.com/ObserveRTC/webextrapp) A client library makes WebRTC platform provided stats observable
 * [WebExtrApp-Integrations](https://github.com/ObserveRTC/integrations) Various integrations for different video platforms providing [WebRTCStats](https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc-stats/).
